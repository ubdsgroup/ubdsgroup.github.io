I am an associate professor in the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu) and the <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/icds"> Institute for Computational and Data Sciences (ICDS)</a> at the <a  href="http://www.buffalo.edu/">State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo</a>. I completed my PhD from <a href="http://www.umn.edu">University of Minnesota</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu">Department of Computer Science</a>. My research is in the area of scalable anomaly detection and data mining for big graphs, temporal, and spatial data.

I lead the UB data science research group. I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/">The Center for Hybrid Rocket Exascale Simulation Technology (CHREST)</a> and the <a href="https://cs4sg.github.io">The Computer Science for Social Good (CS4G) group</a> at UB. I am also the director of the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/icds/programs-and-degrees/cdse.html">ICDS/CDSE PhD program</a>.

<!--font color="red">I am on a temporary leave from UB for next few years, and will be serving as a Program Director in the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OAC">Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure</a>, at the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a>. I will not be taking any new students until then.</font-->
