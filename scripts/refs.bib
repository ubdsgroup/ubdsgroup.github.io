  abstract       = {Manifold learning based methods have been widely used for non-linear dimensionality reduction (NLDR). However, in many practical settings, the need to process streaming data is a challenge for such methods, owing to the high computational complexity involved. Moreover, most methods operate under the assumption that the input data is sampled from a single manifold, embedded in a high dimensional space. We propose a method for streaming NLDR when the observed data is either sampled from multiple manifolds or irregularly sampled from a single manifold. We show that existing NLDR methods, such as Isomap, fail in such situations, primarily because they rely on smoothness and continuity of the underlying manifold, which is violated in the scenarios explored in this paper. However, the proposed algorithm is able to learn effectively in presence of multiple, and potentially intersecting, manifolds, while allowing for the input data to arrive as a massive stream.},

Such systems could have tremendous benefits by providing predictions and suggestions. However, they are limited by the fact that they offer incomplete explanations of their predictions to human decision makers. The objective of this work was to summarize general information that could help users make judgments about whether a system is trustworthy and whether the system’s training “makes sense.” A preliminary study was summarized to show the importance of iterative design and testing for visualizing explanations. }

  abstract = {Scientific data, generated by computational models or from experiments, are typically results of nonlinear interactions among several latent processes. Such datasets are typically high-dimensional and exhibit strong temporal correlations. Better understanding of the underlying processes requires mapping such data to a low-dimensional manifold where the dynamics of the latent processes are evident. While nonlinear spectral dimensionality reduction methods, e.g., Isomap, and their scalable variants, are conceptually fit candidates for obtaining such a mapping, the presence of the strong temporal correlation in the data can significantly impact these methods. In this paper, we first show why such methods fail when dealing with dynamic process data. A novel method, Entropy-Isomap, is proposed to handle this shortcoming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the context of understanding the fabrication process of organic materials. The resulting low-dimensional representation correctly characterizes the process control variables and allows for informative visualization of the material morphology evolution.},

In this article, we discuss several data-driven unsupervised disease subtyping methods to obtain disease subtypes from longitudinal clinical data.

To provide a quantitative comparison of the different methods, we propose a novel evaluation metric that measures the cluster tightness and degree of separation between the various clusters produced by each method. Comparative results for two significantly large clinical datasets are provided, along with key insights that are possible due to the proposed evaluation metric.},

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postsurgical patients experiencing opioid-related adverse drug events have 55% longer hospital stays, 47% higher costs associated with their care, 36% increased risk of 30-day readmission, and 3.4 times higher risk of inpatient mortality compared to those with no opioid-related adverse drug events. Most of the adverse events are preventable. GENERAL AIM: This study explored three types of electronic monitoring devices (pulse oximetry, capnography, and minute ventilation [MV]) to determine which were more effective at identifying the patient experiencing respiratory compromise and, further, to determine whether algorithms could be developed from the electronic monitoring data to aid in earlier detection of respiratory depression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A study was performed in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) in an inner city. Sixty patients were recruited in the preoperative admissions department on the day of their surgery. Forty-eight of the 60 patients wore three types of electronic monitoring devices while they were recovering from back, neck, hip, or knee surgery. Machine learning models were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-four of the 48 patients exhibited sustained signs of opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD). Although the SpO(2) values did not change, end-tidal CO(2) levels increased, and MV decreased, representing hypoventilation. A machine learning model was able to predict an OIRD event 10 min before the actual event occurred with 80% accuracy. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Electronic monitoring devices are currently used as a tool to assess respiratory status using thresholds to distinguish when respiratory depression has occurred. This study introduces a potential paradigm shift from a reactive approach to a proactive approach that would identify a patient at high risk for OIRD. Capnography and MV were found to be effective tools in detecting respiratory compromise in the PACU.},

To this end, recent technological advancement has allowed the production of large volumes of data associated with functioning of these sectors. We are beginning to see that statistical and machine learning techniques can help elucidate characteristic patterns across these systems from water availability, transport, and use to energy generation, fuel supply, and customer demand, and in the interdependencies among these systems that can leave these systems vulnerable to cascading impacts from single disruptions. In this paper, we discuss ways in which data and machine learning can be applied to the challenges facing the energy-water nexus along with the potential issues associated with the machine learning techniques themselves. We then survey machine learning techniques that have found application to date in energy-water nexus problems. We conclude by outlining future research directions and opportunities for collaboration among the energy-water nexus and machine learning communities that can lead to mutual synergistic advantage. }

  abstract = {The energy-water nexus, or the dependence of energy on water and water on energy, continues to receive attention as impacts on both energy and water supply and demand from growing populations and climate-related stresses are evaluated for future infrastructure planning. Changes in water and energy demand are related to changes in regional temperature, and precipitation extremes can affect water resources available for energy generation for those regional populations. Additionally, the vulnerabilities to the energy and water nexus are beyond the physical infrastructures themselves and extend into supporting and interdependent infrastructures. Evaluation of these vulnerabilities relies on the integration of the disparate and distributed data associated with each of the infrastructures, environments and populations served, and robust analytical methodologies of the data. A capability for the deployment of these methods on relevant data from multiple components on a single platform can provide actionable information for interested communities, not only for individual energy and water systems, but also for the system of systems that they comprise. Here, we survey the highest priority data needs and analytical methods for inclusion on such a platform. }

  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Newer analytic approaches for developing predictive models provide a method of creating decision support to translate findings into practice. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a clinically interpretable predictive model for 12-month mortality risk among community-dwelling older adults. This is done by using routinely collected nursing assessment data to aide homecare nurses in identifying older adults who are at risk for decline, providing an opportunity to develop care plans that support patient and family goals for care. METHODS: A retrospective secondary analysis of Medicare and Medicaid data of 635,590 Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS-C) start-of-care assessments from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2012, was linked to the Master Beneficiary Summary File (2012-2013) for date of death. The decision tree was benchmarked against gold standards for predictive modeling, logistic regression, and artificial neural network (ANN). The models underwent k-fold cross-validation and were compared using area under the curve (AUC) and other data science metrics, including Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). RESULTS: Decision tree variables associated with 12-month mortality risk included OASIS items: age, (M1034) overall status, (M1800-M1890) activities of daily living total score, cancer, frailty, (M1410) oxygen, and (M2020) oral medication management. The final models had good discrimination: decision tree, AUC = .71, 95% confidence interval (CI) [.705, .712], sensitivity = .73, specificity = .58, MCC = .31; ANN, AUC = .74, 95% CI [.74, .74], sensitivity = .68, specificity = .68, MCC = .35; and logistic regression, AUC = .74, 95% CI [.735, .742], sensitivity = .64, specificity = .70, MCC = .35. DISCUSSION: The AUC and 95% CI for the decision tree are slightly less accurate than logistic regression and ANN; however, the decision tree was more accurate in detecting mortality. The OASIS data set was useful to predict 12-month mortality risk. The decision tree is an interpretable predictive model developed from routinely collected nursing data that may be incorporated into a decision support tool to identify older adults at risk for death.},

abstract="Most current clustering based anomaly detection methods use scoring schema and thresholds to classify anomalies. These methods are often tailored to target specific data sets with ``known'' number of clusters. The paper provides a streaming clustering and anomaly detection algorithm that does not require strict arbitrary thresholds on the anomaly scores or knowledge of the number of clusters while performing probabilistic anomaly detection and clustering simultaneously. This ensures that the cluster formation is not impacted by the presence of anomalous data, thereby leading to more reliable definition of ``normal vs abnormal'' behavior. The motivations behind developing the INCAD model [17] and the path that leads to the streaming model are discussed.",

abstract = {Database access logs are the starting point for many forms of database administration, from database performance tuning, to security auditing, to benchmark design, and many more. Unfortunately, query logs are also large and unwieldy, and it can be difficult for an analyst to extract broad patterns from the set of queries found therein. Clustering is a natural first step towards understanding the massive query logs. However, many clustering methods rely on the notion of pairwise similarity, which is challenging to compute for SQL queries, especially when the underlying data and database schema is unavailable. We investigate the problem of computing similarity between queries, relying only on the query structure. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of three query similarity heuristics proposed in the literature applied to query clustering on multiple query log datasets, representing different types of query workloads. To improve the accuracy of the three heuristics, we propose a generic feature engineering strategy, using classical query rewrites to standardize query structure. The proposed strategy results in a significant improvement in the performance of all three similarity heuristics.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: As chronic kidney disease (CKD) is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the world with various rate of progression among patients, identifying its phenotypic subtypes is important for improving risk stratification and providing more targeted therapy and specific treatments for patients having different trajectories of the disease progression. PROBLEM DEFINITION AND DATA: The rapid growth and adoption of electronic health records (EHR) technology has created a unique opportunity to leverage the abundant clinical data, available as EHRs, to find meaningful phenotypic subtypes for CKD. In this study, we focus on extracting disease severity profiles for CKD while accounting for other confounding factors. PROBABILISTIC SUBTYPING MODEL: We employ a probabilistic model to identify precise phenotypes from EHR data of patients who have chronic kidney disease. Using this model, patient's eGFR trajectory is decomposed as a combination of four different components including disease subtype effect, covariate effect, individual long-term effect and individual short-term effect. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: The discovered disease subtypes obtained by Probabilistic Subtyping Model for CKD are presented and their clinical relevance is analyzed. DISCUSSION: Several clinical health markers that were found associated with disease subtypes are presented with suggestion for further investigation on their use as risk predictors. Several assumptions in the study are also clarified and discussed. CONCLUSION: The large dataset of EHRs can be used to identify deep phenotypes retrospectively. Directions for further expansion of the model are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Anomaly detection for symbolic sequence data is a highly important area of research and is relevant in many application domains. While several techniques have been proposed within different domains, understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses is limited. The key factor for this is that the nature of sequence data varies significantly across domains, and hence while a technique might perform well in its original domain, its performance is not guaranteed in a different domain. In this paper, we aim at establishing this understanding for a wide variety of anomaly detection techniques for symbolic sequences. We present a comparative evaluation of a large number of anomaly detection techniques on a variety of publicly available as well as artificially generated data sets. Many of these are existing techniques while some are slight variants and/or adaptations of traditional anomaly detection techniques to sequence data. The analysis presented in this paper allows relative comparison of the different anomaly detection techniques and highlights their strengths and weaknesses. We extend the reference based analysis (RBA) framework, which was originally proposed to analyze multivariate categorical data, to analyze symbolic sequence data sets. We visualize the symbolic sequences using the characteristics provided by the RBA framework and use the visualization to understand various aspects of the sequence data. We then use the characterization done by RBA to understand the performance of the different techniques. Using the RBA framework, we propose two anomaly detection techniques for symbolic sequences, which show consistently superior performance over the existing techniques across the different data sets.},

   abstract = {Analyzing database access logs is a key part of performance tuning, intrusion detection, benchmark development, and many other database administration tasks.

In this paper, we present LogR, a lossy log compression scheme suitable for use in many automated log analytics tools, as well as for hu- man inspection. We formalize and analyze the space/fidelity trade-off in the context of a broader family of “pattern” and “pattern mixture” log encodings to which LogR belongs. We show through a series of experiments that LogR com- pressed encodings can be created efficiently, come with prov- able information-theoretic bounds on their accuracy, and outperform state-of-art log summarization strategies.},
