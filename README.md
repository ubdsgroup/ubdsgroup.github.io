## Build site

To build the website locally, clone the repo with:

```
git clone https://github.com/ubdsgroup/website.git
```

Then install necessary Ruby dependencies by running `bundle install` from within the `blotter` directory.  After this, the site can be be built with:

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

(If you are getting errors at this stage, it may be due to your version of `bundle`. Try `gem uninstall bundler` + `gem install bundler -v 1.13.1`.)

To view the site, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and point a browser to `http://localhost:4000/`.  More information on Jekyll can be found [here](http://jekyllrb.com/).

To include projects, preprocessing scripts are necessary to clone project repos and update Jekyll metadata. This can be accomplished with:

```
ruby _scripts/update-and-preprocess.rb
```

Then `jekyll build` works as normal.
